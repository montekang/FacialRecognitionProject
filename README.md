# FacialRecognitionProject

Facial Recognition system using machine learning techniques
Jan 2020 – Apr 2020

System Security Capstone in Information System Security Program at SAIT.
• Developed Facial Recognition system using machine learning techniques
• Developed a logging system, a log-in system with authentication and an alert system.
• Analyzed machine learning modules such as Haar Cascade Face Detector in OpenCV, HoG Face Detector in Dlib, MTCNN and Keras based on TensorFlow.

[Project Goals]
• The main goal of the project was to make a facial recognition system that you can put in an • access restricted room or area.
• We wanted it to be accurate, be able to identify someone from a far, and to have at least five people that it can recognize.
• Develop a 2 way authentication signup and login function using password based authentication and face based authentication.

[Main functions of the facial recognition system]
• facial recognition function
• logging system
• log-in system with authentication using password, facial recognition.
• alert system for enemy or unknown person.

[project environment]
• Ubuntu 19.10
• webcam installed on the laptop
• python 3.7
• Mysql 8.0
• open-cv module (based on python)
